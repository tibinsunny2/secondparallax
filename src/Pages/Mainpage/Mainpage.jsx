                Nature has many wonders that aren’t changed by human exercises at all or those that exist even with human intervention. All the living and non-living components of nature are dependent on each other, and are collectively called an Ecosystem. An ecosystem consists of several elements; one of its main elements is the Atmosphere.  Air is the layer of gases that covers the earth. Gases that together form the air are nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water droplets. Every gas has a different purpose in our environment, like the Ozone layer protecting us from the dangerous UV radiations. Just like air, water is also an important component of nature. Our earth is covered with large water bodies, like seas and oceans. Seas, as we all know, are made of saltwater. They cover 71 percent of earth’s natural surface. All marine life exists inside the sea biological system.
